The seventh step in [creating a BPM flow chart](Creating-BPM-Flow-Charts) is to run it in debug mode
in the Windows interface. To do so, use the following command:

>`BPM `StatusType` '-g' 'debugfile'

**Example:** To debug the *BPM Flow Chart -- Sales Orders* (in
 Windows): `BPM O -g ..\..\bpm_O.dbg`

The last step is to [insert the initial status into the status table](BPM-Insert-Initial-Status).
