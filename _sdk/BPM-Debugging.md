The seventh step in [creating a BPM flow
chart](Creating-BPM-Flow-Charts ) is to run it in debug mode
in the Windows interface. To do so, use the following command:

>`BPM `StatusType` '-g' 'debugfile'

**Example:** To debug the *BPM Flow Chart -- Sales Orders* (in
 Windows): `BPM O -g ..\..\bpm_O.dbg`

The last step is to [insert the initial status into the status
table](Inserting-the-Initial-Status-into-the-Status-Table ).
