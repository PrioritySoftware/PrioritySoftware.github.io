The seventh step in [creating a BPM flow
chart](Creating_BPM_Flow_Charts "wikilink") is to run it in debug mode
in the Windows interface. To do so, use the following command:

`BPM `*`StatusType`*` -g `*`debugfile`*

> **Example:** To debug the *BPM Flow Chart -- Sales Orders* (in
> Windows): `BPM O -g ..\..\bpm_O.dbg`

The last step is to [insert the initial status into the status
table](Inserting_the_Initial_Status_into_the_Status_Table "wikilink").
