## Dictionaries and Reports 

In addition to enabling the construction and modification of tables, the
*Tables Generator* provides access to dictionaries and reports that
display information on tables already in the database

-   *Table Dictionary* --- Displays all tables in the database; its
    sub-level forms display columns, keys, and key columns.
-   *Column Dictionary* --- Displays attributes of all table columns.
-   *Columns per Table* report
-   *Keys per Table* report.

**Note:** In addition, various utilities accessed via the *SQL
Development* program are helpful in understanding table structure. For
details, see [Viewing Table
Structure](Viewing-Table-Structure ).
