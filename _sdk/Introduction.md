Welcome to Priority's SDK.

This SDK provides a reference for how to use ***Priority's*** internal development tools.

Before you begin, it is essential to be completely familiar with the user interface (see the **Priority User Interface Guide**, available from within ***Priority***). It is also important to be well versed in basic SQL concepts and commands.

The contents of this SDK are based on version 21.1 of ***Priority***. Going forward, features added in newer versions will be marked as such. The SDKs for older versions of Priority are still available in PDF format from [Priority Xpert](https://support.priority-software.com/#/).

Please note that the SDK is technical in nature and does not go into licensing requirements that may be necessary for working with some features. The customer / partner is responsible for ensuring they have the necessary licensing to work with these features.
