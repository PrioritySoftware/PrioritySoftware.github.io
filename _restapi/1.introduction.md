## Introduction

The Priority REST API is based on the Open Data Protocol (OData), a data access protocol built on HTTP and REST. This documentation provides basic examples of the various requests and responses you can make using the Priority REST API. For a more detailed understanding of OData, please refer to [OData Documentation](http://www.odata.org/documentation/).

### Service Root URL

All the examples in this documentation are based on sample requests made to a Priority OData service. Please replace the <code>serviceRoot</code> below with a service root URL appropriate to your installation of **Priority**. Note that all other URLs in the OData service use this URL as a basis.
Consult with your System Administrator if you are not sure what the service root for your installation is.

### Authentication

There are 3 ways you can authenticate with the REST API:

1.  Basic Authentication: This is the default and most straightforward authentication method. Every HTTP request contains an authentication header according to the Basic-Authentication standard, in order to apply any relevant permission restrictions. HTTP requests that lack such a header are denied.
In this case, you need to consult with your System Administrator to obtain a valid username and password.

2. OAuth2: This is generally used for 3rd-party access to the API. The API client needs to implement the [OAuth2 flow](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2), and provide an Authorization header of `Bearer`. Note that this option requires the purchase of the External ID module for Priority.

3. Personal Access Token (PAT): Newly introduced in version 19.1 of Priority. With this method, the admin can set a secret token to be used by the client in order to authenticate. Multiple PATs can be associated with a single Priority user, and they can be replaced or deleted independently of one another. PATs can be defined in the **REST Interface Access Tokens** form in Priority. When using this method, the Authorization header should be set to Basic, the username should the PAT that was defined, and the password should be hardcoded to `PAT`.

**Note:** You cannot use Basic Authentication (method 1) while External ID access is enabled.

### Application License

In version 18.3, Priority Software introduced an additional form of licensing - per-application licenses. When accessing the system under this license, requests to the Priority OData service must contain additional headers providing application license information:

| Header | Contents |
| X-App-Id | The unique application ID assigned to your application by Priority Software. |
| X-App-Key | The unique application license key assigned to your application by Priority Software. |

Example:
```
X-App-Id: APP001
X-App-Key: 15nXqSDXnNeaIEFQSSDXkNeZ16DXodeV16TXmSDXoteb16nXmdeVISEh
```

Requests that do not contain these headers will be treated as using generic API licensing.


<a class="anchor-link" name="Features_by_Version"></a>
###  Features by Version  ###
Certain features are tagged with a version number reflective of the Priority version in which they were released. Features in development are marked as `Beta`, indicating they will be available in the next Priority release. 
In certain cases, features (including beta features) can be obtained for previous versions of Priority pending a request to Priority Software.

### Postman Collection
[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/3ff6b2a738857d25c712)

You can use this [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) collection to run the requests in the API against our demo environment. For authentication, use the following credentials:

Username **apidemo**

Password **123**

### Error Message Format

Starting with version 19.1 of Priority, the REST API can output errors in either JSON or XML format. 

To change the error format, ask the Priority System Administrator to change the value of the RESTERRSFORMAT constant in Priority. System constants can be found through the menu path **System Management > System Maintenance > Constant Forms > System Constants** in Priority.
