## Introduction

The Priority REST API is based on the Open Data Protocol (OData), a data access protocol built on HTTP and REST. This documentation provides basic examples of the various requests and responses you can make using the Priority REST API. For a more detailed understanding of OData, please refer to [OData Documentation](http://www.odata.org/documentation/).

### Service Root URL

All the examples in this documentation are based on sample requests made to a Priority OData service. Please replace the <code>serviceRoot</code> below with a service root URL appropriate to your installation of **Priority**. Note that all other URLs in the OData service use this URL as a basis.
Consult with your System Administrator if you are not sure what the service root for your installation is.

<a class="anchor-link" name="Authentication"></a>
### Authentication

The Priority OData service requires that every HTTP request contain an authentication header according to the Basic-Authentication standard, in order to apply any relevant permission restrictions. HTTP requests that lack such a header will be denied.
Consult with your System Administrator if you do not have a valid user or password.

#### Personal Authentication Tokens

Accessing the API via Personal Authentication Tokens is currently in `Beta` and is availible upon request from version 18.3 of Priority.

To use an authentication token to access the Rest API, your System Administrator must first generate the token. To access the Rest API via the token, specify the following credentials:

Username **PAT**

Password **INSERT TOKEN HERE**

### Application License

In version 18.3, Priority Software introduced an additional form of licensing - per-application licenses. When accessing the system under this license, requests to the Priority OData service must contain additional headers providing application license information:

| Header | Contents |
| X-App-Id | The unique application ID assigned to your application by Priority Software. |
| X-App-Key | The unique application license key assigned to your application by Priority Software. |

Example:
```
X-App-Id: APP001
X-App-Key: 15nXqSDXnNeaIEFQSSDXkNeZ16DXodeV16TXmSDXoteb16nXmdeVISEh
```

Requests that do not contain these headers will be treated as using generic API licensing.


<a class="anchor-link" name="Features_by_Version"></a>
###  Features by Version  ###
Certain features are tagged with a version number reflective of the Priority version in which they were released. Features in development are marked as `Beta`, indicating they will be available in the next Priority release. 
In certain cases, features (including beta features) can be obtained for previous versions of Priority pending a request to Priority Software.
