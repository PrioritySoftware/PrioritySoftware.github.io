<a class="anchor-link" name="priorityReady"></a>
### priorityReady()
This method is automatically called by the SDK when it has fully loaded. Use it as the entry point for your client side logic.
Ensure that 'priorityReady' is called **first**, before you start calling any other SDK methods. This is particularly important if you choose to include the SDK via a script (as opposed to npm).
Define this function as a global function:
```js
window.priorityReady = () => {
  //Call some API method here.
}
```

<a class="anchor-link" name="login"></a>
### login(configuration) ⇒ <code>Promise</code>

Use this function to initialize the system and login. A succesful login also returns the  [`LoginFunctions`](#LoginFunctions) object.

| **Param** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| configuration | [`Configuration`](#Configuration) | Environment configuration object.|

**Returns**: <code>Promise</code> 
 
**Resolve**: [`LoginFunctions`](#LoginFunctions) Object

**Reject**: [`ServerResponse`](#ServerResponse)

<a name="Configuration"></a>
##### Configuration : <code>Object</code>
**Properties**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| url | <code>string</code> | URL to the Priority WCF service without the "wcf/wcf/service.svc" part (i.e. the URL configured for the Priority Application Server). |
| tabulaini | <code>string</code> | tabula.ini file name. |
| language | <code>number</code> | Language code. This determines the language of messages provided by the server, e.g. **3** - American English. |
| profile | <code>object</code> | The internal name of the company in Priority to log into.  |
| appname | <code>string</code> | Application Name - (When developing for **Priority**, can be accessed in forms and procedures using the variable :WEBSDK_APP_NAME) |
| username | <code>string</code> | Username. This is the user's **standard** user name in the system, and not the one specially defined for REST API in the **Personnel File** form in Priority.|
| password | <code>string</code> | Password. |
| devicename | <code>string</code> | Name of the device (additional information that is logged in the connection log). May be an empty string.|
| appid | <code>string</code> | If your application uses a per-application license to connect to Priority (as opposed to generic API license), the unique application ID assigned to your application by Priority Software. |
| appkey | <code>string</code> | If your application uses a per-application license to connect to Priority (as opposed to generic API license), the unique application license key assigned to your application by Priority Software. |
| activeDirectory | <code>boolean</code> | Optional - use if your organization works with Active Directory. If set to **1**, login information  in *username* and *password* should match the user's Windows credentials. *Supported in version 18.1 and above of Priority.* |

**Priority Cloud**

Priority installations hosted on the public cloud (AWS) all share the same URL, and are distinguished by differing tabula.ini files. For production environments, the url is: \
<code>https://p.priority-connect.online/wcf/service.svc</code>

For test environments, the prefix is an **s**, instead:\
<code>https://s.priority-connect.online/wcf/service.svc</code>


##### profile: <code>Object</code>
**Properties**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|company| <code>string</code>| The internal name of a company in Priority. You can find the internal name in the **Companies** form within Priority. |
|group?| <code>number</code>| If the user has multiple user groups (user profiles) in Priority, the id of the desired user group in Priority. Optional |

**Note:** If you are unsure what to enter in *url*, *tabulaini*, and *profile*, check with the **Priority** system administrator.

**Example:**

```js
const priority = require('priority-web-sdk');

async function webSDK() {

let config={
  url:<your url>,
  tabulaini:<your tabula.ini>,
  language: 3,
  profile: {
                company: 'test',
            },
  appname:'demo',
  username:<your username>,
  password: <your password>,
  devicename:'', 
  X-App-Id: 'APP001',
  X-App-Key: '15nXqSDXnNeaIEFQSSDXkNeZ16DXodeV16TXmSDXoteb16nXmdeVISEh'
};
try { 
    await priority.login(config)
    console.log('Your are in!! Enjoy!')
}
catch(reason){
    console.error(reason.message)
}
};
```

**Personal Authentication Tokens**

Accessing the SDK via Personal Authentication Tokens is available as of version 19.1 of Priority

To use an authentication token to access the SDK, your System Administrator must first generate the token. To access the SDK via the token, specify the following credentials:


```js
const priority = require('priority-web-sdk');

async function webSDK() {

let config={
  url: <your url>,
  tabulaini: <your tabula.ini>,
  language:3,
  profile: {
                company: 'test',
            }
  appname:'demo',
  username:<your token>,
  password: 'PAT',
  devicename:'', 
  X-App-Id: 'APP001',
  X-App-Key: '15nXqSDXnNeaIEFQSSDXkNeZ16DXodeV16TXmSDXoteb16nXmdeVISEh'
};
try { 
    await priority.login(config)
    console.log('Your are in!! Enjoy!')
}
catch(reason){
    console.error(reason.message)
}
};
```

<br/>
<br/>

#### Verifying the WCF URL

As Priority Cloud is gradually migrating to the public cloud (AWS), we are making a slight change to the path to the WCF service used by WebSDK.

- On the private cloud, the path is : .../wcf/wcf/service.svc
- On the public cloud, the path is : .../wcf/service.svc

In the interim, you might want to add some code that verifies the URL provided to your app is correct. You can use the Fetch api to check various variations:

```js
async function checkUrlRequest(serverUrl, resolve, reject) {
        let success = false;
        if (serverUrl.toLowerCase().includes('service.svc')) {
            return resolve(serverUrl);
        }
        success = await this.tryFetch(serverUrl + '/wcf/service.svc');
        if (success) {
            return resolve(serverUrl);
        }
        success = await this.tryFetch(serverUrl + '/wcf/wcf/Service.svc');
        if (success) {
            return resolve(serverUrl);
        } 
        return reject({message: 'No WCF service found in URL'});
}       
```

You can of course extend this code with additional validations, for customers with their own private installations and setups.


<a class="anchor-link" name="formStart"></a>
### formStart(formName , onShowMessgeFunc , onUpdateFieldsFunc , profile , autoRetrieveFirstRows) ⇒ <code>Promise</code>

Opens a [Form](../form/#Form).
Call this method once for each [Form](../form/#Form) you want to open. 

A [Form](../form/#Form) will stay open until you end it. Once open, you can use all of its methods.

| **Param** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| formName | <code>string</code> | The internal (uppercase) name of the form, e.g. '**ORDERS**'. |
| onShowMessgeFunc | [`MessagesCallback`](#MessagesCallback) | Callback function for handling error and warning messages. |
| onUpdateFieldsFunc | [UpdateFieldsCallback](#UpdateFieldsCallback) | Callback function for handling form field updates. |
| profile | [`Profile`](#Profile) | Object containing the company and user group in which to open the form. |
| autoRetrieveFirstRows | <code>number</code> | **1**: When opening the form, retrieve records (rows) according to the default query and store them locally. If no default query exists, retrieve top records for form. **2**: Retrieve rows according to the user's default query, if it exists. If no default query exists, open the form but do not retrieve any rows. **0**: Open the form, but do not run a query. |

**Returns**: <code>Promise</code> 
 
**Resolve**: [`Form`](../form/#Form)

**Reject**: [`ServerResponse`](#ServerResponse) 
<br>

<a name="FormStartSuccessCallback"></a>
##### FormStartSuccessCallback : <code>function</code>
 
| **Param** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| form | [`Form`](#Form) | Form Object. The name of the form that was started. |

<br/>
<br/>

<a name="MessagesCallback"></a>
##### MessagesCallback : <code>function</code>
A callback passed to the [`formStart`](#formStart) function. Use it to display messages received from the server.

This callback is called by the SDK whenever messages are received from the server after calling a Form Object method.

**Notes**: 
  - If the server returns an **error** after calling an API method, it indicates the action has resulted in a **Priority** error and the promise is rejected. The error message will be returned through `messagesCallback`, but any <code>catch</code> block will run.
  - When the server returns a **warning** after calling an API method, it indicates the user has encountered a warning message where they must decide whether to continue the action or cancel it. The warning message will be returned to the `messagesCallback` and the action will not be completed until:
     
     - The action is approved despite the warning - [`warningConfirm`](../form/#warningConfirm) is called with 'okCancel' = 1. In this case the original promise that triggered the warning is resolved.
     - The action is canceled due to the warning - [`warningConfirm`](../form/#warningConfirm) is called with 'okCancel' = 0. In this case the original promise that triggered the warning is rejected.
  - When the server returns an **information** message after calling an API method, it indicates the user has encountered an informational message regarding the current action (for example, a message related to a customer that was selected). This message simply needs to be confirmed. The message will be returned to the `messagesCallback` and the action will be completed once the [`infoMsgConfirm`](../form/#infoMsgConfirm) function is called.

| **Param** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| serverResponse| [`ServerResponse`](#ServerResponse) | Server response that contains a message.|

<br>

<a name="UpdateFieldsCallback"></a>
##### UpdateFieldsCallback : <code>function</code>

A callback function passed to the [`formStart`](#formStart) function.
This callback is called by the SDK when updates to a [Form's](../form/#Form) row or field are received from the server.
Updates can be received after performing certain actions, including:
  - [`fieldUpdate`](../form/#fieldUpdate)
  - [`saveRow`](../form/#saveRow)
  - [`undo`](../form/#undo)
  - [`delRow`](../form/#delRow)
  Methods that include updates will be noted as such, and will call this function.
  
**Note:** This callback should be carefully implemented to cover all  'update' cases, in order to ensure local data is always synchronized with data on the server.  

| **Param** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| result | [`Rows`](#Rows) | Updated rows.|

**Example:**  
```js
let customersForm;

const updateFieldsCallback = (updates)=> {
  if(updates["CUSTOMERS"] != null) {
    Object.assign(customersForm.rows,updates["CUSTOMERS"]);
  }
}

const messagesCallback = (serverMessage)=> {
  alert(serverMessage.message);
}

try {
customersForm = await formStart("CUSTOMERS", updateFieldsCallback, messagesCallback)
...
}
catch {
  //reject
}
```

<a class="anchor-link" name="formStartEx"></a>
### formStartEx(formName , onShowMessgeFunc , onUpdateFieldsFunc , profile , autoRetrieveFirstRows , exParams) ⇒ <code>Promise</code>

Opens a [Form](../form/#Form) in a special mode that can call on additional parameters.
Specifically, you can use the exParams object to specify a row number and this function will open the form and retrieve that row (when the [getRows](../form/#getRows) method is called).

**Note:** Other parameters of formStartEx are identical to those of [`formStart`](#formStart).

#### exParams : object

Contains additional parameters used by the formStartEx function.

**Properties**

| **Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
