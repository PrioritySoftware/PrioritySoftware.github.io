| marketgateUrl | string | URL component used to construct URL to access the consent interface. Only provided if *userConsent* is 0.|

#### Checking User Consents

After a successful login, check the **userConsent** property of the [`LoginFunctions`](#LoginFunctions) object. If the value is 1 (consent has been given), login can proceed as usual. If the value is 0, the user has not yet provided consent, and the consent interface should be called.

To call the consent interface, you must construct a URL based on the following instructions, and open it within a frame.

**URL Structure**
```
mg + "?" + "WWWUSERCONSENTS" + "&_tabulaini=" + TABULAINI + "&_uselang=" + LANGUAGE + "&_portal=1" + "&_html5=1";
```

Where:

* **mg** is the value of the **marketgateUrl** property of the [`LoginFunctions`](#LoginFunctions) object.
* **TABULAINI** is the tabula.ini file name used during [`login`](#login).
* **LANGUAGE** is the language code used during [`login`](#login).

Once the consent interface has been opened, call **isUserConsent** repeatedly (every second) to check whether the user has provided consent. If the returned value is 1, consent has been provided, and login can proceed as usual.
