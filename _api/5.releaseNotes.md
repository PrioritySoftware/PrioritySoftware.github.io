## Web SDK Release Notes (Version 2.0.2)

Following feedback from developers, we've revised the time format used with the SDK. When providing time and datetime, add the timezone offset (e.g. 2018-08-14T10:00:00.000+03:00).

## Web SDK Release Notes (Version 2.0.1)

### SDK Changes

The [`fileUpload`](../api/form/#uploadFile)  and **uploadDataUrl**[`uploadDataUrl`](../api/form/#uploadDataUrl) functions now require an additional callback, *onProgress*. When uploading a large file, *onProgress* is called while the upload is still in progress; *onSuccess* is only called when the file upload completes successfully. This corrects the issue with Promises for these functions. 
As a consequence of this change, the *isLast* property of the [`FileUploadResult`](../api/form/#FileUploadResult) object is no longer necessary and has been removed.

Added two new functions [`filterChooseAction`](../api/form/#choose) and [`filterSearchAction`](../api/form/#SearchAction), which allow you to bypass business process restrictions when creating a filter for a form. 

Date fields  no longer accept or send a relative, text-based date such as *Tomorrow* or *Beginning of next week*. Additionally, dates must be formatted according to ISO standards, ~~and times should be in UTC~~.

The rest of this release is mostly about increasing uniformity between procedures and forms in areas that overlap between the two.
1. [`choose`](../api/procedure/#choose) function: the object name in the response was changed to Search (previously Choose).
2. [`inputOptions`](../api/procedure/#inputOptions) function, **Options** object: the *help* property was renamed to *helpstring*.
4. [`ProcError`](../api/procedure/#cancel) object, *text* property was renamed *message*.
5. [`inputFields`](../api/procedure/#inputOptions) function, **EditFields** object has had several changes:
    - Removed the properties *isboolean* and *columntype*.
    - Added properties *code* and *type* (these function the same way as those of the Column object in forms).
    - Added the *format* property (specifies the format of a date, such as 'DD/MM/YY')
    - *Width* property renamed to *maxlength*.
6.  The [`proc`](../api/procedure) object has two new properties, *name* and *title*, that provide the internal name and title of the procedure being run.
