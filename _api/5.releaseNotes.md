## Web SDK Release Notes (Version 2.0.1)

### SDK Changes

The **fileUpload** and **uploadDataUrl** functions now require an additional callback, *onProgress*. When uploading a large file, *onProgress* is called while the upload is still in progress; *onSuccess* is only called when the file upload completes successfully. This corrects the issue with Promises for these functions. 
As a consequence of this change, the *isLast* property of the **FileUploadResult** object is no longer necessary and has been removed.

The rest of this release is mostly about increasing uniformity between procedures and forms in areas that overlap between the two.
1. Date fields in procedures no longer accept or send a relative, text-based date such as *Tomorrow* or *Beginning of next week*. Additionally, dates must be formatted according to ISO standards (similar to forms), and times should be in UTC.
3. choose function: the object name in the response was changed to Search (previously Choose).
2. **Search** object: Properties *str1* and *str2* changed to *string1* and *string2*, as in forms.
4. inputOptions function, **Options** object: the *help* property was renamed to *helpstring*.
5. **ProcError** object, *text* property was renamed *message*.
6. inputFields function, **EditFields** object has had several changes:
    - Removed the properties *isboolean* and *columntype*.
    - Added properties *code* and *type* (these function the same way as those of the Column object in forms).
    - Added the *format* property (specifies the format of a date, such as 'DD/MM/YY')
    - *Width* property renamed to *maxlength*.
7.  The **proc** object has two new properties, *name* and *title*, that provide the internal name and title of the procedure being run.
