<a name="Proc"></a>
## Proc: object type
**Properties**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | string| The procedure's unique uppercase 'Priority' name. |
| title | string| The procedure's descriptive title. |

<a class="anchor-link" name="Introduction"></a>
### Introduction

Priority's procedures are usually a sequence of individual steps, with some of them requiring user input. Only after the input for a step is complete does the procedure move on to the next step. Running procedures via the Web SDK follows the same structure. When a procedure is called, the response includes (in the **data** object) the current input step, which can be one of several types. These step types are outlined in the table below. 

| Step Type | Description | Corresponding Functions |
| --- | --- | --- |
|[`inputFields`](#inputFields)| Fields that require user input. | inputFields|
| [`inputOptions`](#inputOptions)| Present a choice to the user.|inputOptions|
|[`inputHelp`](#inputHelp)| Displays help text regarding the procedure |inputHelp |
|[`message`](#message)| An error/warning/informational message displayed by the procedure. |message|
|[`upload`](#fileUpload)| Allows the user to specify a file to upload for processing by the procedure. |uploadFile or uploadDataUrl|
|[`reportOptions`](#reportOptions)| If multiple formats are defined for a report, allows the user to choose the desired format.|reportOptions|
|[`documentOptions`](#documentOptions)| If multiple formats are defined for a document, allows the user to choose the desired format.|documentOptions|
|[`displayUrl`](#continueProc)| Contains the display url of a produced report/document.|continueProc|
|['client'](#client)| Sends data from the server to the client. | clientContinue |
|`end`| Indicates the procedure has ended (due to error/completion).| None necessary.|

For each step type, there is a corresponding function to be called to fill in the input. Once input is specified, [`ProcSuccessCallback`](#ProcSuccessCallback) is called again, and the next procedure step that requires input is returned from the server, with its own step type. This continues until the end of the procedure is reached (the `end` step type is returned).

Here's an example of this workflow, using the **Order Confirmation** procedure, which creates an order confirmation document on the server.

1. We run the **WWWSHOWORDER** procedure using [`procStart`](../global/#procStart).
2. ['ProcSuccessCallback'](#ProcSuccessCallback) is called, and returns a **data** object, with a step type of [`documentOptions`](#documentOptions), allowing the user to choose the print format for the order confirmation.
3. We respond to this step type by using the corresponding **documentOptions** function, specifying the desired print format.
4. ['ProcSuccessCallback'](#ProcSuccessCallback) is called again, this time returning a step type of [`inputFields`](#inputFields), where the user can pick the order to print a confirmation for.
5. We use the corresponding **inputFields** function to respond to this step type, specifying the order to print.
6. The server now creates the file, so this time, the step type returned is [`displayUrl`](#continueProc), informing us of where the file is saved on the server.
7. To continue the procedure, we use the corresponding **continueProc** function.
8. Finally, ['ProcSuccessCallback'](#ProcSuccessCallback) returns a step type of 'end'. This lets us know the procedure has been completed.

### ProcSuccessCallback : <code>function</code>

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| data | <code>Object</code> | The step reached by the procedure (the type of input it requires) .|

The data object can be one of several types, and each type has a corresponding function to address that type. Function names are almost always identical to the type they correspond to. Once one of these functions completes, it automatically calls ProcSuccessCallback for the next step of the procedure, until the **end** step is reached.
For example, when generating an Order Confirmation document, the first instance of *ProcSuccessCallback* will yield a data object containing **documentOptions**. After specifying the desired format with the *documentOptions* function, *ProcSuccessCallback* is called again and yields a data object of the type **inputFields**, where the user can specify for which order to generate the confirmation document using *inputFields*, and so on.

<br/>
<a class="anchor-link" name="inputFields"></a>
#### inputFields: <code>object type</code>
This data type describes a dialog where the user has to fill in one or more fields in order for the procedure to run. It is the most common procedure data type.

**Note:** Dates should be sent and received as ISO formatted dates. Time should include the timezone offset (e.g. 2018-08-14T10:00:00.000+03:00).

 Structure of the data object:

|Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|proc| object | The current procedure's object |
|type | string | Describes the data type ("inputFields")|
|input| inputFieldInput | Container|

Example:
```js
input:Object {EditField: Array[2], Operators: Array[9], text: "", …}
proc:Object {}
type:"inputFields"
```

##### input: <code>array</code>

|Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|EditField|array| Contains the input fields for the procedure. |
|Operators|object| Contains information about the possible operators.|
|text|string| Contains help text for the input dialog.|
|title|string| The title of the input dialog.|

Example:
```js
EditField:Array[2] [Object, Object]
Operators:Array[9] [Object, Object, Object, …]
text:""
title:"Parameter Input"
```

##### EditField: <code>array</code>

|Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|code|string| One of "Str" / "Rstr" / "Bool" / "Real" / "Int" / "Date8" / "Date10" / "Date14" / "Time5" / "Time6" |
|type|string| Describes the type of variable in *code* - text, checkbox, number, date, or time.|
|field|number| Field ID.|
|helpstring|string| Contains the help text for the specific input field.|
|ispassword | number | Indicates if the field is a password. |
|mandatory | number | Indicates if the field is mandatory and must be filled. |

**Note:** A zoom value of "Attach" in a field indicates that the input should consist of a file. Use the [fileUpload](#fileUpload) method to fill in this value - it will automatically add the file's location on the server as the input (once upload is complete).

Example:
```js
0:Object {field: 1, helpstring: "\nSpecify the code of the special offer in which yo…", isboolean: 0, …}
columntype:"Str"
field:1
helpstring:"\nSpecify the code of the special offer in which you want to include customers."

### ProcProgressCallback : <code>function</code>

Use this function to update a progress bar. This function is called by the SDK whenever a progress bar is called on the server by the procedure itself.

Note that as long as a progress bar was not called by the procedure on the server, this function WOULD NOT be called, even if the procedure is taking a long time (e.g., due to a long-running query).

Therefore, you should always use some sort of action indicator. Change it to a percentage indicator when this callback is called.

| **Param** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| proc |`Proc` | Procedure Object. |
| progress | <code>Number</code> | 0-100. |

### ProcErrorCallback : <code>function</code>

| **Param** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| proc | `Proc`| Procedure Object. |
| error | [`ProcError`](#ProcError) | Object.{ type: (string) - type of message: "NotSupported" / "ServerBusy" / "Error", message: (string) - text of message }  |

### ProcError : <code>Object</code>
**Properties**

| **Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| proc | `Proc`| Procedure Object. |
| type | <code>string</code> | The error type: "NotSupported" / "ServerBusy" / "Error" |
| message | <code>string</code> | Error text |

For example, a ProcError might look like this:

```js
proc:Object {}
message:"step GANTT is not supported"
type:"NotSupported"
```

<a class="anchor-link" name="choose"></a>

### choose(fieldId, value, data, successCallback, errorCallback)
Opens a choose/search operation for a specified field.  A successful Choose function results in both a generic [Proc](#Introduction) object (describing the current procedure) and a Search object that can contain either 'ChooseLine' values or 'SearchLine' values. The type of values in the object is not predefined for each field, but is rather dependent on the number of results - if the number is large, 'ChooseLine' is replaced by 'SearchLine'. Therefore, after a successful Choose, make sure your code can address both types of results.

 **Note:** 
 If the field currently cotains a value, it will automatically be filled in as `value`, even if a different `value` was specified. 


| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fieldId | <code>number</code> | ID of field. |
| value | <code>string</code> | Current value in field. |
| data | <code>ChooseFields</code> | Data in all procedure input fields (Choose/Search results may vary depening on other fields' values). |
| successCallback | [`OpenChooseCallback`](#OpenChooseCallback) | Called on success. |
| errorCallback | [`ErrorCallback`](#ProcErrorCallback) | Called on error. |


#### ChooseFields <code>object type</code>

This object displays all the fields in the current procedure, of which some may affect the current choose operation. For example, if you filled in a customer, and are currently choosing a price quote, it might limit the choose operation only to price quotes opened for that customer. This object contains the *ChooseField* array:

##### ChooseField <code>array type</code>

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| field | <code>number</code> | The ID value of the input field. |
| value | <code>string</code> | Current value in this input field. |

<a class="anchor-link" name="searchAction"></a>

### searchAction(fieldId, value, action, data, successCallback, errorCallback)
Perform action in search dialog.
Performs one of the following actions on the previously opened choose/search field:
- Next(1) - Retrieve more search results.
- Prev(2) - Retrieves the previous search results. 
            Usually, this action is unnecessary, as previously retrieved results are cached locally.
- TypeChange(3) - Change the 'search-by' method.
  Available methods are: _By Name_, _By Number_, _By Foreign Name_.
- TextChange(4) - Changes the search query text.
- StartChange(5) - Specifies that the search should look for results that **start** with the query text.
- IgnoreCaseChanged(6) - When running a search in English (or other languages with uppercase and lowercase), toggles the 'ignoreCase' flag on or off.


| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fieldId | <code>number</code> | ID of field. |
| value | <code>string</code> | Current value in field. |
| action | <code>number</code> | One of: Next(1),Prev(2),TypeChange(3),TextChange(4),StartChange(5),IgnoreCaseChanged(6) |
| data | <code>ChooseFields</code> | Data in all fields (Search may be dependent on other fields' values). |
| successCallback | [`SearchActionCallback`](#SearchActionCallback) | called on success. |
| errorCallback | [`ErrorCallback`](#ProcErrorCallback) | called on error. |
