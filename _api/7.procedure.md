## Proc: object type
**Properties**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | string| The procedure's unique uppercase 'Priority' name. |
| title | string| The procedure's descriptive title. |

<a class="anchor-link" name="Introduction"></a>
### Introduction

Priority's procedures are usually a sequence of individual steps, with some of them requiring user input. Only after the input for a step is complete does the procedure move on to the next step. Running procedures via the Web SDK follows the same structure. When a procedure is called, the response includes (in the **data** object) the current input step, which can be one of several types. These step types are outlined in the table below. 

| Step Type | Description | Corresponding Functions |
| --- | --- | --- |
|[`inputFields`](#inputFields)| Fields that require user input. | inputFields|
| [`inputOptions`](#inputOptions)| Present a choice to the user.|inputOptions|
|[`inputHelp`](#inputHelp)| Displays help text regarding the procedure |inputHelp |
|[`message`](#message)| An error/warning/informational message displayed by the procedure. |message|
|[`upload`](#fileUpload)| Allows the user to specify a file to upload for processing by the procedure. |uploadFile or uploadDataUrl|
|[`reportOptions`](#reportOptions)| If multiple formats are defined for a report, allows the user to choose the desired format.|reportOptions|
|[`documentOptions`](#documentOptions)| If multiple formats are defined for a document, allows the user to choose the desired format.|documentOptions|
|[`displayUrl`](#continueProc)| Contains the display url of a produced report/document.|continueProc|
|['client'](#client)| Sends data from the server to the client. | clientContinue |
|`end`| Indicates the procedure has ended (due to error/completion).| None necessary.|

For each step type, there is a corresponding function to be called to fill in the input. Once input is specified, the promise is resolved, and the next procedure step that requires input is returned from the server, with its own step type. This continues until the end of the procedure is reached (the `end` step type is returned).

Here's an example of this workflow, using the **Order Confirmation** procedure, which creates an order confirmation document on the server.

1. We run the **WWWSHOWORDER** procedure using [`procStart`](../global/#procStart).
2. The promise is resolved, returning a *proc* object with a type of [`inputFields`](#inputFields), where the user can pick the order to print a confirmation for.
3. We use the corresponding **inputFields** function to respond to this step type, specifying the order to print.
4. When the promise is resolved, the *proc* object is returned with a step type of [`documentOptions`](#documentOptions), allowing the user to choose the print format for the order confirmation.
5. We respond to this step type by using the corresponding **documentOptions** function, specifying the desired print format.
7. The server now creates the file, so this time, the step type returned is [`displayUrl`](#continueProc), informing us of where the file is saved on the server.
8. To continue the procedure, we use the corresponding **continueProc** function.
9. Finally, we get back a step type of 'end'. This lets us know the procedure has been completed.

### data : <code>Object</code>

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| data | <code>Object</code> | The step reached by the procedure (the type of input it requires) .|

The data object can be one of several types, and each type has a corresponding function to address that type. Function names are almost always identical to the type they correspond to. All of these functions return promises, and when resolved return a new data object for the next step of the procedure, until the **end** step is reached.
For example, when generating an Order Confirmation document, upon starting the procedure, the promise resolves wiht a data object of type **inputFields**. After specifying which order to generate the confirmation document for using the *inputFields* function, the server returns a new data object of type **documentOptions**. You can then select the desired print format with the *documentOptions* function, which returns a new data object with a different type, and so on.

<a class="anchor-link" name="inputFields"></a>
#### inputFields: <code>object type</code>
This data type describes a dialog where the user has to fill in one or more fields in order for the procedure to run. It is the most common procedure data type.


 Structure of the data object:

|Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|proc| object | The current procedure's object |
|type | string | Describes the data type ("inputFields")|
|input| inputFieldInput | Container|

Example:
```js
input:Object {EditField: Array[2], Operators: Array[9], text: "", …}
proc:Object {}
type:"inputFields"
```

##### input: <code>array</code>

|Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|EditField|array of objects| Contains the input fields for the procedure. |
|Operators|object| Contains information about the possible operators.|
|text|string| Contains help text for the input dialog.|
|title|string| The title of the input dialog.|

Example:
```js
EditField:Array[2] [Object, Object]
Operators:Array[9] [Object, Object, Object, …]
text:""
title:"Parameter Input"
```

##### EditFields: <code>array</code>

|Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|code|string| One of "Str" / "Rstr" / "Bool" / "Real" / "Int" / "Date8" / "Date10" / "Date14" / "Time5" / "Time6" |
|type|string| Describes the type of variable in *code* - text, checkbox, number, date, or time.|
|field|number| Field ID.|
|helpstring|string| Contains the help text for the specific input field.|
|ispassword | number | Indicates if the field is a password. |
|mandatory | number | Indicates if the field is mandatory and must be filled. |
|operator|number | Default operator (saved from the previous run).|
|readonly | boolean | Indicates if the field is read-only, i.e. it must use values from a choose list. |
|title|string| The field's title. |
|value|string| Default value (saved from the previous run).|
|value1|string| Default second value (if operator is "between").|
|maxlength|number| Field's maximum length.|
|zoom|string| Various field attributes ("None" / "Attach" / "Search" / "Choose" / "Zoom" / "Date14" /  "Date8" / "Date10" / "EMail" / "URL" / "HiddenZoom" / "LinkFile" / "QEdit" / "SpecialAttach").|

**Note:** A zoom value of "Attach" in a field indicates that the input should consist of a file. Use the [fileUpload](#fileUpload) method to fill in this value - it will automatically add the file's location on the server as the input (once upload is complete).

Example:
```js
0:Object {field: 1, helpstring: "\nSpecify the code of the special offer in which yo…", isboolean: 0, …}
columntype:"Str"
field:1
helpstring:"\nSpecify the code of the special offer in which you want to include customers."
mandatory:0
operator:0
readonly:0
title:"Offer Code"
value:"1"
value1:""
width:56
zoom:"Choose"
```

##### Operators: <code>array</code>

|Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|name|string|Operator name|
|op|number|Operator ID|
|title|string| Operator title|

Example:
```js
0:Object {name: "= ", op: 0, title: "equals"}
name:"= "
op:0
title:"equals"

```

**Possible Operators**

Some operators might not be available in certain situations. For example, if the input fields include **From Date** and **To Date**, an exact date (equals) must be specified.

|name| op | title |
|--|--|--|
| "= " | 0 | "equals" |
| "< " | 1 | "less than" |
| "<=" | 2 | "less than or equal to" |
| "> " | 3 | "greater than" |
| ">=" | 4 | "greater than or equal to" |
| "<>" | 5 | "not equal to" |
| "- " | 6 | "between" |
| "! " | 7 | "and NOT" |
| "\| " | 8 | "or" |

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ok | <code>number</code> | 1: OK, 0: Cancel. Move to the next step of the procedure with the input in *data*, or cancel the procedure entirely. |
| data | object | The desired input for this step, specified within the object. |

<br/>


<a class="anchor-link" name="formZoom"></a>
#### formZoom(fieldID, onShowMessgeFunc , onUpdateFieldsFunc , profile , autoRetrieveFirstRows , exParams)

Use this function to drill-down into a form that contains source data for a certain input field. This replicates the standard Priority functionality of "zooming" into a form to retrieve input.
This function behaves almost identically to the [formStartEx](../api/global/#formStartEx) function for forms, except that rather than specifying the form, you specify the field ID of an input field.

| **Param** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fieldId | int | Field ID of one of the current input fields |
| onShowMessgeFunc | [`MessagesCallback`](#MessagesCallback) | Callback function for handling error and warning messages. |
| onUpdateFieldsFunc | [UpdateFieldsCallback](#UpdateFieldsCallback) | Callback function for handling form field updates. |
| profile | [`Profile`](#Profile) | Object containing the company and user group in which to open the form. |
| autoRetrieveFirstRows | <code>number</code> | **1**: When opening the form, retrieve records (rows) according to the default query and store them locally. If no default query exists, retrieve top records for form. **2**: Retrieve rows according to the user's default query, if it exists. If no default query exists, open the form but do not retrieve any rows. **0**: Open the form, but do not run a query. |


This function only works on input fields with a *zoom* value of **zoom**, **choose**, and **search**, although it is only available in certain **choose** and **search** fields.

After the user retrieved the desired data, use the standard [endCurrentForm](../form/#endCurrentForm) function to return to the procedure, while setting a value in the *returnJustThisRow* parameter.

This returns a **proc** object of type *zoomvalue*.

#### zoomvalue <code>object type</code>
This data type is returned after an attempt to zoom into a form from a procedure in order to retrieve data. It either describes a failure to zoom into the form, or the retrieved values.

|Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|proc| object | The current procedure's object |
|haszoom | boolean | Describes the result of the zoom. 0 failed, 1 successful|
|field| int | The field in which the zoom was performed|
|value | string | If a single value is retrieved (that is, *returnJustThisRow* is true when using **endCurrentForm**), shows the value. If haszoom is 1 and this string is empty, multiple values were retrieved. |

Example:
```js
{

                "proc": {
                                "title": "Print Sales Invoice",
                                "name": "WWWSHOWAIV",
                                "session": "AVIAPC26360z1608046859y167"
                },
                "type": "zoomvalue",
                "haszoom": 1,
                "field": 1,
                "value": ""

}
```

In this example, the zoom was successful and multiple records were retrieved - several Sales Invoices were selected.

After zoom is complete, you can continue the procedure as if you returned to the **inputFields** object type - either zooming into additional input, letting the user enter data in the input fields, or continuing the procedure with the *inputFields* function.


<a class="anchor-link" name="inputOptions"></a>
#### inputOptions: <code>object type</code> 
This data type describes a dialog where the user has to select an option in order for the procedure to run. In **Priority's** web interface, these options would show as radio buttons (if there are more than 8, as a listbox). Structure of the data object:

|Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|proc| object | The current procedure's object |
|type | string | Describes the data type ("inputOptions")|
|input| object | Container|

Example:
```js

<a class="anchor-link" name="ProcProgressCallback"></a>
### ProcProgressCallback : <code>function</code>

Use this function to update a progress bar. This function is called by the SDK whenever a progress bar is called on the server by the procedure itself.

Note that as long as a progress bar was not called by the procedure on the server, this function WOULD NOT be called, even if the procedure is taking a long time (e.g., due to a long-running query).

Therefore, you should always use some sort of action indicator. Change it to a percentage indicator when this callback is called.

| **Param** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| proc |`Proc` | Procedure Object. |
| progress | <code>Number</code> | 0-100. |

### ProcError : <code>thrown error</code>

| **Param** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| proc | `Proc`| Procedure Object. |
| error | [`ProcError`](#ProcError) | Object.{ type: (string) - type of message: "NotSupported" / "ServerBusy" / "Error", message: (string) - text of message }  |

<a class="anchor-link" name="ProcError"></a>
### ProcError : <code>Object</code>
**Properties**

| **Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| proc | `Proc`| Procedure Object. |
| type | <code>string</code> | The error type: "NotSupported" / "ServerBusy" / "Error" |
| message | <code>string</code> | Error text |

For example, a ProcError might look like this:

```js
proc:Object {}
message:"step GANTT is not supported"
type:"NotSupported"
```

<a class="anchor-link" name="choose"></a>

### choose(fieldId, value, data)
Opens a choose/search operation for a specified field.  A successful Choose function resolves in both a generic [Proc](#Introduction) object (describing the current procedure) and a Search object that can contain either 'ChooseLine' values or 'SearchLine' values. The type of values in the object is not predefined for each field, but is rather dependent on the number of results - if the number is large, 'ChooseLine' is replaced by 'SearchLine'. Therefore, after a successful Choose, make sure your code can address both types of results.

 **Note:** 
 If the field currently cotains a value, it will automatically be filled in as `value`, even if a different `value` was specified. 


| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fieldId | <code>number</code> | ID of field. |
| value | <code>string</code> | Current value in field. |
| data | <code>ChooseFields</code> | Data in all procedure input fields (Choose/Search results may vary depening on other fields' values). |


#### ChooseFields <code>object type</code>

This object displays all the fields in the current procedure, of which some may affect the current choose operation. For example, if you filled in a customer, and are currently choosing a price quote, it might limit the choose operation only to price quotes opened for that customer. This object contains the *ChooseField* array:

##### ChooseField <code>array type</code>

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| field | <code>number</code> | The ID value of the input field. |
| value | <code>string</code> | Current value in this input field. |


<br/>

<a class="anchor-link" name="searchAction"></a>

### searchAction(fieldId, value, action, data)
Perform action in search dialog.
Performs one of the following actions on the previously opened choose/search field:
- Next(1) - Retrieve more search results.
- Prev(2) - Retrieves the previous search results. 
            Usually, this action is unnecessary, as previously retrieved results are cached locally.
- TypeChange(3) - Change the 'search-by' method.
  Available methods are: _By Name_, _By Number_, _By Foreign Name_.
- TextChange(4) - Changes the search query text.
- StartChange(5) - Specifies that the search should look for results that **start** with the query text.
- IgnoreCaseChanged(6) - When running a search in English (or other languages with uppercase and lowercase), toggles the 'ignoreCase' flag on or off.


| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fieldId | <code>number</code> | ID of field. |
| value | <code>string</code> | Current value in field. |
| action | <code>number</code> | One of: Next(1),Prev(2),TypeChange(3),TextChange(4),StartChange(5),IgnoreCaseChanged(6) |
| data | <code>ChooseFields</code> | Data in all fields (Search may be dependent on other fields' values). |

#### ChooseFields <code>object type</code>

This object displays all the fields in the current procedure, of which some may affect the current search operation. For example, if you filled in a customer, and are currently choosing a price quote, it might limit the search operation only to price quotes opened for that customer. This object contains the *ChooseFields* array:

##### ChooseField <code>array type</code>

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| field | <code>number</code> | The ID value of the input field. |
| value | <code>string</code> | Current value in this input field. |
