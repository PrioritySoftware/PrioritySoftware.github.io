The following examples are implemented using NodeJS, and use *async/await* to perform asynchronous functions.

## Running a Report

To start with, log in to Priority; set the configuration object based on your own environment.

```js
"use strict";

const priority = require('priority-web-sdk');

const conf = {
  username: 'me', password: 'xxxx',
  url: 'https://www.eshbelsaas.com',
  tabulaini: 'tabula.ini',
  language: 3,
  company: 'ui'
};

(async () => {
  try {
       
    await priority.login(conf);
```

Start the report. In this example, we'll use **ABC for Raw Materials**.

```js
    let procStepResult = await priority.procStart('ABCRAW', 'P');
```

The server responds with step type *inputOptions*. This means we need to select an option and press ok.
We can see the available options by accessing <code>input.options</code>.

```js
    procStepResult = await procStepResult.proc.inputOptions(1 , 1);
```

The server responds with the next step type *inputFields*, which means we need to provide data in specific fields.
We can check the required fields by accessing <code>input.EditFields</code>. In this case, we need to provide a start and end date, both in format **Date8**.

```js
    var data = {EditFields: [
      {field: 1, op: 0, value: '01/08/20'},
      {field: 2, op: 0, value: '31/08/20'}
    ]};
    procStepResult = await procStepResult.proc.inputFields(1 , data);
```

The next step is once again *inputFields*. This time we need to provide a single field.
    
```js
    data = {EditFields: [
      {field: 1, op: 0, value: '*'}
    ]}; 
    procStepResult = await procStepResult.proc.inputFields(1 , data);
```

The next step type received is *displayUrl*. This means the report was prepared by the server and can be accessed. The report is available in the *Urls* property.

Based on server configuration, this might be a url to the report which can be downloaded seperately, or a DataURI which contains the report data.

```js
    console.log(procStepResult.Urls);

    await procStepResult.proc.continueProc();  // Finish the proc execution context
  } catch(err) {
    console.log('Something bad happened:');
    console.dir(err);
  }
})();
```
