# Priority Web SDK

Welcome to **Priority**'s Web SDK.

Use this SDK to develop apps that allow users to perform a variety of actions. A few examples:

* Open a Form, retrieve rows and display them however you like.
* Open a search list and update a field based on the user's choice.
* Run Direct Activations, open sub-level Forms, attach files, and much, much more.

## Usage
You can enable access to the SDK in one of two ways - using npm or as a script in your index.html file.
#### NPM
[https://www.npmjs.com/package/priority-web-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/priority-web-sdk){:target="_blank"}

Run : `npm install priority-web-sdk --save`

#### JAVASCRIPT

Include the following script in your index.html file:

[https://cdn.priority-software.com/upgrades/var/api/v1.5/priorityapp.nocache.js](https://cdn.priority-software.com/upgrades/var/api/v1.5/priorityapp.nocache.js)

## Keep in Mind

- Server responses can be handled as either callbacks or [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise){:target="_blank"}. Both are supported.
- Some methods **must** be called in a certain order for them to work.

That's it! Go ahead and get started with this awesome tool. We are eagerly awaiting your feedback.
