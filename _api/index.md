## Important stuff

- Server responses can be handled in callbacks or in [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise){:target="_blank"}. Both of them are supported.

- Some methods **must** be called in a certain order for them to work.

That's it!! Go ahead and start using this awesome tool.
