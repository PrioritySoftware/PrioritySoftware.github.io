# Priority Web SDK

Welcome to **Priority**'s Web SDK.

Use this SDK to develop apps that allow users to perform a variety of actions. A few examples:

* Open a form, retrieve rows and display them however you like.
* Open a search list and update a field based on the user's choice.
* Run Actions, open sub-level forms, attach files, and much, much more.

## Usage
You can enable access to the SDK in one of two ways - using npm or as a script in your index.html file.
#### NPM
[https://www.npmjs.com/package/priority-web-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/priority-web-sdk){:target="_blank"}

Run : `npm install priority-web-sdk --save`

#### JAVASCRIPT

Include the following script in your index.html file:

[https://cdn.priority-software.com/upgrades/var/api/head/priorityapp.nocache.js](https://cdn.priority-software.com/upgrades/var/api/v1.5/priorityapp.nocache.js)

## TypeScript

If you work with TypeScript, feel free to import the type definitions for the various objects included in the WebSDK, such as Form, Proc, and more. Object types are specified as part of the documentation.

```ts
import { formStart, Form } from 'priority-web-sdk'

let myForm : Form;
startForm('CUSTOMERS',...).then((form: Form) => {
     // do something
})
```

## Dates and Times

* Date (date8) fields accept dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
* Date+time (date14) fields accept dates and times in ISO format. Times should include the timezone offset (e.g. 2018-08-14T10:00:00.000+03:00)

**Deprecated:** Prior to version 3.0.0 of the Web SDK, date (date8) fields would also accept dates with times.

## Keep in Mind

- Server responses can be handled as either callbacks or [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise){:target="_blank"}. Both are supported.
- Some methods **must** be called in a certain order for them to work.
