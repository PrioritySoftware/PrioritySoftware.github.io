<a class="anchor-link" name="warningConfirm"></a>
### warningConfirm(okCancel)

Confirms a server warning message. Every operation can trigger a warning messages on the server. 

This method is used to make the server aware of the last operation's state:
- If the the user **approves** the action despite the warning message, specify **1** in the 'okCancel' parameter. When the server completes the operation, it will call the 'onSuccess' or 'onFulfill' function of the last server call.
- If the the user **cancels** the action following the warning message, specify **0** in the 'okCancel' parameter. When the server completes the operation it will call the 'onError' or 'onReject' function of the last server call.

<a class="anchor-link" name="choose"></a>
### choose( fieldName , fieldValue, [onSuccess] , [onError] ) ⇒ `Promise`

Opens a choose/search operation for a specified field. A successful Choose function results in a Search object that can contain either 'ChooseLine' values or 'SearchLine' values. The type of values in the object is not predefined for each field, but is rather dependent on the number of results. 'ChooseLine' is only shown when there is a small number of results (no more than a single page of results). If there are more results than can be displayed in a single page, it is replaced by 'SearchLine'. Therefore, after a successful Choose, make sure your code can address both types of results.
 
 **Note:** 
 If the field currently contains a value, it will automatically be filled in as `fieldValue`, even if a different `fieldValue` was specified. 

| **Param** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fieldName | string| The field's name (for example CUSTNAME). |

<a class="anchor-link" name="filterChoose"></a>
### filterChooseAction(action, searchText, [onSuccess], [onError]) ⇒ `Promise`

Certain forms in Priority are subject to Business Process Management (BPM) restrictions. This means that users are restricted in the values they can see when running a ['choose'](#choose) on a *Status* or *Assigned To* column. This can be an issue when users want to search for documents according to these values. This function circumvents this limitation and displays all available values. Use it when constructing a filter through user input.

In all other respects, this function is completely identical to [`choose`](#choose).

            Usually, this action is unnecessary, as previously retrieved results are cached locally.
- TypeChange(3) - Change the 'search-by' method.
  Available methods are: _By Name_, _By Number_, _By Foreign Name_.
- TextChange(4) - Changes the search query text.
- StartChange(5) - Specifies that the search should look for results that **start** with the query text.
- IgnoreCaseChanged(6) - When running a search in English (or other languages with uppercase and lowercase), toggles the 'ignoreCase' flag on or off.

| QueryValues | [`QueryValue[]`](#QueryValue)| Array of query values to filter. Each query value defines the field to filter, relational operator, values and sort options. When using OR operator, you should limit your query  to 4 fields.  |

**Notes**
  - You can only query a field once per filter. 
  - Search is performed from the beginning of valid field values. For example, when querying a number-only field with a value such as "*100", the "*" in the beginning will be ignored.
  - The filter object must contain all of its members. For example if you don't use `toval` send an empty string but don't send the filter without `toval`.

```js
{
 or: (number),
 ignorecase: (number),
 QueryValues:
 [{
   field: (string),
   fromval: (string),
   toval:  (string),
   op: (string),
   sort: (number),
