## Global

<a class="anchor-link" name="priorityReady"></a>
### priorityReady()
This method is automatically called by the SDK when it has fully loaded. Use it as the entry point for your client side logic.
Ensure that 'priorityReady' is called **first**, before you start calling any other SDK methods. This is particularly important if you choose to include the SDK via a script (as opposed to npm).
Define this function as a global function:
```js
window.priorityReady=function()
{
  //Call some API method here.
}
```

Opens a [Form](../form/#Form).
Call this method once for each [Form](../form/#Form) you want to open. 

A [Form](../form/#Form) will stay open until you end it. Once open, you can use all of its methods.

| **Param** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| formName | <code>string</code> | The internal (uppercase) name of the form, e.g. '**ORDERS**'. |
| onShowMessgeFunc | [`MessagesCallback`](#MessagesCallback) | Callback function for handling error and warning messages. |

<a name="FormStartSuccessCallback"></a>
##### FormStartSuccessCallback : <code>function</code>
 
| **Param** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| form | [`Form`](#Form) | Form Object. The name of the form that was started. |

<br/>
<br/>

<a name="MessagesCallback"></a>
##### MessagesCallback : <code>function</code>
A callback passed to the [`formStart`](#formStart) function. Use it to display messages received from the server.

This callback is called by the SDK whenever messages are received from the server after calling a Form Object method.

**Notes**: 
  - If the server returns an **error** after calling an API method, it will be returned through `messagesCallback` and not `rejectCallback`, although both methods will be invoked.
  - When the server returns a **warning** after calling an API method, the warning will be returned to the `messagesCallback` and the action will not be completed until:
     
     - The action is approved despite the warning - [`warningConfirm`](../form/#warningConfirm) is called with 'okCancel' = 1. In this case the server will call the `successCallback` of the method.
     - The action is canceled due to the warning - [`warningConfirm`](../form/#warningConfirm) is called with 'okCancel' = 0. In this case the server will call the `rejectCallback` of the method.

| **Param** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| serverResponse| [`ServerResponse`](#ServerResponse) | Server response that contains a message.|

<br>

<a name="UpdateFormCallback"></a>
##### UpdateFormCallback : <code>function</code>

A callback function passed to the [`formStart`](#formStart) function.
This callback is called by the SDK when updates to a [Form's](../form/#Form) row or field are received from the server.
Updates can be received after performing certain actions, including:
  - [`fieldUpdate`](../form/#fieldUpdate)
  - [`saveRow`](../form/#saveRow)
  - [`undo`](../form/#undo)
  - [`delRow`](../form/#delRow)
  Methods that include updates will be noted as such, and will call this function.
  
**Note:** This callback should be carefully implemented to cover all  'update' cases, in order to ensure  local data is always synchronized with data on the server.  

| **Param** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| result | [`Rows`](#Rows) | Updated rows.|

**Example:**  
```js
var customersForm;

function updateFormCallback(updates) {
  if(updates["CUSTOMERS"] != null) {
    Object.assign(customersForm.rows,updates["CUSTOMERS"]);
  }
}

function messagesCallback(serverMessage) {
  alert(serverMessage.message);
}

formStart("CUSTOMERS", updateFormCallback, messagesCallback).then(function(form) {
      customersForm = form;
    },function() {
      //reject
    });
```
