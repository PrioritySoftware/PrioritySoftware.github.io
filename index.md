# Welcome to Priority's Developer Portal

## Web SDK
Priority Software is proud to present a javascript based Web SDK that communicates with **Priority** forms, procedures and more.

In addition to the SDK reference, we've also included a tutorial to help you get started and demonstrate how it all meshes together.

We also offer source code for a template application that uses Typescript, Angular and Ionic2.

## REST API

Priority Software's REST API leverages the OData protocol to easily enable access to data in **Priority** forms. 

The documentation provides examples of how to request, query, and modify data using the API.
